- Personal injuriescan get worse. Your movement or movement of your passengers at the location of the crash can lead to further injuries. If you have injuries to your head, neck, or back, it is best to wait for the police emergency services to arrive before you leave.
- Contact 911 for emergencies.911 can alert emergency services such as the fire department, police department, and paramedics to your emergency.
- The fire department employees are trained and prepared to handle rescue operations as well as hazards from fires, broken glass, debris, and dangerous chemicals.
- The police officers can further ensure your safety by shutting down and directing traffic away from your crash location. Police officers can also write a report, which can be extremely valuable to your personal injury case.Be truthful with the facts of the accident. Never guess as to what caused the accident. Speculating may seriously harm your personal injury case.

- Paramedics can assist with assessing and treating your injuries at the crash location. When necessary, paramedics will be the source of transport to a hospital for you to receive further medical care.Even if you believe you have no injuries it is important to still be checked out by paramedics because car accidents can cause shock and a rush of adrenaline, which may make you unaware of the true extent of your injuries.Oftentimes, the actual nature of your injuries are not felt until later in the day or a day after the accident.

- What is a Wrongful Death Claim?
- A wrongful death claim is a claim brought by a loved one or the estate of a person who died as a result of awrongful act, neglect, carelessness, unskillfulness, or defaultby another party.
- How to Prove a Wrongful Death Claim
- A wrongful death claim is similar to a negligent action claim because both require the same elements to be proved. The elements that need to be proved are as follows:
- The defendant owed the decedent a duty of care.
- The defendant breached this duty of care.
- The defendantâ€™s breach was the proximate cause of death.
- The death resulted in damages.
- The available damages include:
- the decedentâ€™s pre-death pain and suffering
- medical bills prior to death
- post death costs such as funeral and burial costs
- the decedentâ€™s loss of future income
- the loss of a decedentâ€™s parentage, nurturing, and love
- Who Can Bring a Wrongful Death Claim?
- The parents, children, and the spouse of the decedent can file a claim in Texas. Any one of these persons can file the claim individually or the claim can be filed as a group. Additionally, the executor of the decedentâ€™s estate can file a claim. However, the executor must wait 3 months to file a claim. If the parents, children, or spouse of the decedent files a claim before this time then the executor cannot file a claim. An executor also cannot file a claim if specifically requested not to do so by the decedentâ€™s parent, child, or spouse.
- Unlike in other states which require the child to be a minor to file a claim, in Texas, a decedentâ€™sâ€™ child can be any age when he or she files a claim. Additionally, any decedentâ€™s natural born or adopted child can file a claim, as long as the child has been legally adopted. However, because a the biological parentsâ€™ rights to an adopted child cease once the child is adopted, the adopted child cannot file a claim for the wrongful death of a biological parent. Similarly, a biological parent cannot file a claim for the death of their child that has been adopted by someone else.
- Texas prevents the decedentâ€™s siblings and grandparents from filing a claim.

- Your visit to a doctor could be for a variety of reasons including a routine check up, a cold, or even surgery. The last thing on your mind is that you will leave the doctorâ€™s office immediately worse off or be left worse off weeks or months down the line because of the doctorâ€™s negligence. While this can be shocking for some, it is a reality for hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. According toJohns Hopkins Medicine, medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the United States per year.250,000 Americans die per year frompreventable medical errors.If medical malpractice victims never gets the appropriate legal representation they may never be compensated for a doctorâ€™s negligence.
- What is Medical Malpractice?
- Medical malpractice occurs when a doctor, hospital, or healthcare professional negligently acts or does not act in a manner that injures a patient. A doctor, hospital, or health care professional acts negligently when they act or do not act in a manner that a reasonably prudent doctor, hospital, or healthcare professional would act.
- Should a Doctor be Held Responsible for Negligent Acts
- Ultimately the decision of whether doctors should be held responsible for their negligent acts is left to the injured victim, or unfortunately, the relatives or estate of a person who died because of a doctorâ€™s negligence. However, from a lawyerâ€™s respective, Stolmeier Law has seen far too many medical malpractice victims refuse to file a personal injury lawsuit because they like their doctor. Thestatute of limitationsfor a medical malpractice suit is 2 years. So once 2 years passes from the date of your injury or the date you discover your injury you can no longer file a personal injury lawsuit. These victims that refuse to file a lawsuit begin to regret it as they are left with mounting medical bills as a result of the doctorâ€™s negligence and can no longer work because of the injuries caused by the doctor. No one should be immune from their mistakes, not even doctors.
